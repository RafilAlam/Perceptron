# 🧠 Perceptron Classifier  
🔨 **Building the Foundations of Neural Networks**  
> A simple **Perceptron** implementation in Python, which is a fundamental building block for neural networks. This classifier learns a linear decision boundary by adjusting weights based on a given training set using the Perceptron learning rule.

## 🛠️ Features
- Simple **Perceptron** classifier implementation  
- Trains on a given dataset using the **Perceptron Learning Rule**  
- Adjusts weights based on error between predicted and actual outputs  
- Supports binary classification with an activation function to return either `1` or `-1`
